# Refactor Number Practice

Clone down this repo. Make sure you are familiar with the current functionality (i.e., run the app in the browser!)

- There are many refactoring opportunities here. With your partner, decide on one area to focus your energy.
- Decide if you want to pair or work solo, but either way, work on the same goal.
- While you are refactoring, make sure you are utilizing console.log and checking what is happening in the browser.
- Once you feel like you are done, ensure that the app is behaving as it originally was in the browser. Make sure to clean up any old comments, old code, whitespace, etc.
